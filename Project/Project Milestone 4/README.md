Upload the image file you want to segment into the Shiny web application.
Click on the "Upload your tile image" button to select and upload the image.
The application will display the original image, probability map, and segmented image.

Instructions on how to run any notebook (if applicable) :

You can run this in any env. Just choose GPU. This speeds things up significantly.

The notebook is laid out step-by-step. Just run each cell in order, from installing packages to visualizing the segmentation results. If there are instructions or comments in the notebook, they'll guide you through what each part does. And that's pretty much it!
