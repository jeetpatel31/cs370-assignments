Instructions on how to run the code : 

For Problem 1, ensure your environment has Python with numpy, matplotlib, and scipy. Run the script (saved as a .py file) in your Python environment. The script generates a plot of a bivariate Gaussian distribution with contours and sampled points.

For Problem 2, First make sure you have Python installed, along with the numpy and matplotlib libraries - you can install them using pip if you don't have them already. Then open the Python script in an IDE like Visual Studio Code or a basic text editor. Run the script, and it will generate a plot.png image file in the same folder showing a static projection of the 3D Gaussian vectors.

Instructions on how to run any tests (if applicable):

Running Tests for Problem 1 (Bivariate Gaussian Simulation)
Test Cases: For Problem 1, you would typically write tests to check if the generated samples correctly match the specified bivariate Gaussian distribution. This could include verifying the mean, covariance, and distribution of the points.

Execution: Run these tests by executing the test functions within the same environment where the simulation code runs. Observe the output to confirm if the generated data aligns with the expected statistical properties.


Running Tests for Problem 2 (3D Gaussian Vector Projection)
Test Cases: For Problem 2, tests could involve checking the accuracy of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the orthogonality of the principal components, and the correctness of the 3D to 2D projection.

Execution: Similar to Problem 1, execute these test functions within your Python environment and review the results to ensure the SVD and projection are performed correctly.
